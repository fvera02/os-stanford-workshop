## Content
This repository includes:
* A `LICENSE.md` file
* A `CITATION.cff` file
These files were created in real-time during the workshop to illustrate appropriate licensing and citation of a repository.

The repository also houses a `.png` file of the logo used in this `README.md`.

## Usage
The files in this repository serve as examples of licensing and citation files to include in the top level of a repository. To use effectively, refer to `LICENSE.md` and `CITATION.cff` as examples of text to include and their naming conventions to ensure readability by GitHub.
